# Soil-Classification
I use the Decision Tree and Random Forest Methods to predict soil-type.

The overall goal of this project was to predict the soil-type based on field-level measurements of topsoil for farmers in less developed countries. As a result of knowing the soil-type, these farmers then have a better knowledge of how to tend the crops and field.

## Note: I could not include the data with the models
